Software Description: Utility used to generate depth maps for a series of image sequences (.raw) of the 4 CC.

// The code contains some test data sets, a matlab file to crop the image sequences and generate the original and the depth map in a side-by-side viewing fashion. 


//--------------------------------------------------------------------
RUNNING FROM COMMANDLINE:

Before you can compile the program, you need to make sure that OpenCV is installed on the system.
Make sure that you cna link to the following from your environment. 

-lopencv_core -lopencv_highgui  -lopencv_imgproc  


The code has been tested with OpenCV 2.4.9. The make file is present in the Debug/ directory.
simply type make to compile the code.


RUN COMMAND:
 ./DepthEstimator  -input  checkerboard_parameters.txt



RUNNING FROM ECLIPSE:
The project can be imported in Eclipse.


//--------------------------------------------------------------------
RUNNING SAMPLES.

Ther are 2 samples provided with the code 


1. CHECKER BOARD WARPING SAMPLE
RUN COMMAND: 
./DepthEstimator  -input  checkerboard_parameters.txt

DESCRIPTION:
This sample shows how the warping (after fixing distortion) alligns points in the scene at a known depth and plane normal. The parameter file provides the normal and the depth at which the cheackerboard plane is exists in the real world.

Running the code outputs 3 types of png images.
input_x.png: The input that was given to the algorithm.

undistort_x.png: The input images undistorted using the known camera parameters.

undistort_minus_warped_x.png: The warped image is subtracted from the camera_0 undistorted image. This image shows the bias in the estimation since the checker board should completely allign and should cancel out after the subtraction.

No depth estimation is run after the images are written.
 

OUTPUTS:
Outputs are generated inside the Debug/ directory.







2. DEPTH ESTIMATION FOR FACE CLOSEUP DATA SET
RUN COMMAND:
./DepthEstimator  -input face_closeup_7_29_14_parameters.txt

DESCRIPTION: 

This parameter file outputs the depth maps for the input sequence present in test_data/face_closeup_7_29_14. All the parameters are preset and some sample images are also provided.

OUTPUTS:
Outputs are generated inside the following directories,

test_data/face_closeup_7_29_14/depth_maps_grey/
test_data/face_closeup_7_29_14/depth_maps_bin/


test_data/face_closeup_7_29_14/sample_output/ contains some sample pngs that should be generated inside the depth_maps_grey/ folder after you run the utility.
